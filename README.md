# Tracking Robot

This project is a simple Java console application that simulates a robot picking up items based on the shortest Manhattan distance from its current location.  
It demonstrates basic Java concepts such as:

- Input handling with `Scanner`
- Arrays and boolean flags
- Greedy algorithm (nearest point search)

## Purpose

This program was developed as part of preparation for Java-based problem-solving competitions.  
It focuses on logic building, coordinate processing and decision-making with basic Java syntax.

## Features

- Takes input for robot’s starting position and item coordinates
- Calculates nearest item using Manhattan distance
- Displays optimal pickup sequence

## Sample Output

```
Enter number of items: 3
Enter starting position: 0 0
Enter coordinates for item 1: 1 2
Enter coordinates for item 2: 3 1
Enter coordinates for item 3: 0 1
Pickup Sequence: 3 1 2
```

## How to Run

1. Open the project folder in any Java IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code)
2. Make sure the file is named `Main.java`
3. Compile and run the program
4. Enter the input values as prompted
